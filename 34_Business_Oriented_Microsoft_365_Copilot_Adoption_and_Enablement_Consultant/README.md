# Business-oriented Microsoft 365 Copilot Adoption & Enablement Consultant

**Project 34 | Independent business-side consulting and learning-design portfolio**

## In one sentence
Show how a consultant helps executives, HR, Finance, Sales and operational teams **identify useful Microsoft 365 Copilot workflows, learn them through practical exercises, adopt them safely, and measure whether working practices improve**.

**This is NOT** Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) accreditation, a tenant configuration, a real client deployment, or evidence that these workshops were delivered to a customer. It is an original, fully documented learning and change-adoption *design* with synthetic materials. English-language delivery is assumed; no other language proficiency is claimed.

## What a workshop participant actually does
A learner begins with a real *type* of business problem (represented here by fictional data), uses a safe prompt and the relevant Copilot experience where available, reviews its output against the source, then decides what needs human verification. The learning design focuses on **judgement, adoption and change of behaviour**, not buttons, superficial prompt lists, or unverified promises that AI always saves time.

## Run analytics
Python 3.10+; no Microsoft credentials or external dependencies:

~~~bash
python src/adoption_report.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

## Compatibility and product truth
Microsoft 365 Copilot experiences, grounding, in-app availability, cross-app access and advanced features **vary by licence, tenant configuration, permissions, product updates and region**. Demos must be checked in the actual client tenant before facilitation. Microsoft published materials explain this distinction:

## Evidence statement
All names, metrics, business documents, results, delivery plans and workshop schedules are **synthetic portfolio examples**, not verified client activities or personally delivered commercial workshops. There is **no account connection, user telemetry, Microsoft product testing, recording or learner attendance evidence** in this repository.
