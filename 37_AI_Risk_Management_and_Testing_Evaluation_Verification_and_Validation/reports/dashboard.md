# AI Assurance Evidence Dashboard — Simulated

> Educational mock responses only. No live LLM, legal content, real assurance audit, or fairness claim.

**Release recommendation: HOLD** (synthetic critical-risk gate; human approval still required).

## Interpretation and limitations
- A source notification is not equivalent to approved change implementation.
- A correct-looking answer without current evidence is an exception.
- A small synthetic sample cannot demonstrate real-world accuracy, reliability, demographic fairness, security or regulatory compliance.
- These percentages are descriptive of mock fixtures only. A real release gate needs risk-based thresholds, representative samples, qualified experts and independent review.
- The HOLD recommendation is a demonstration of a proposed governance control, not an automated production blocker.
